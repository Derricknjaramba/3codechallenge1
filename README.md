            Files and Their Functionalities
            
 add_numbers.py
Contains the add_numbers function which returns the sum of two numbers.

 is_even.py
Contains the is_even function which checks if a number is even and returns True or False.

reverse_string.py
Contains the reverse_string function which returns the reversed version of the given string.

count_vowels.py
Contains the count_vowels function which counts the number of vowels in a string, ignoring case.

calculate_factorial.py
Contains the calculate_factorial function which returns the factorial of a non-negative integer.

apply_decorator.py
